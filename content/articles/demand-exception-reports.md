# Demand Exception Reports: Purpose, Review Process, and Practical Challenges

A **Demand Exception Report** is an analytical tool used in demand planning and Sales and Operations Planning (**S&OP**) to identify products that require human investigation.

Rather than asking planners to review every SKU, customer, warehouse, or SKU-location combination during each planning cycle, the report highlights only the items that breach predefined tolerance rules. These exceptions may include unusually large forecast errors, persistent forecast bias, unexpected demand spikes, stockout-related distortions, or significant deviations from a launch plan.

This approach is commonly known as **management by exception**.

Its purpose is not simply to produce a list of inaccurate forecasts. A useful exception report should help planners answer three practical questions:

- Which demand signals require attention?
- Why did the exception occur?
- What planning action should be taken?

The report therefore acts as a bridge between statistical forecasting and business judgement.

## Why Demand Exception Reports Are Needed

A demand planner may be responsible for hundreds or thousands of SKU-location combinations. Reviewing every forecast line manually is inefficient and can cause planners to spend too much time on stable products while overlooking the few exceptions that create most of the operational risk.

A demand exception report directs attention towards items that may result in:

- stockouts and lost sales;
- excess or obsolete inventory;
- poor production or procurement decisions;
- distorted statistical forecasts;
- inappropriate safety-stock settings;
- incorrect launch or promotional assumptions; and
- unresolved differences between the statistical forecast and commercial expectations.

The report is therefore both a planning control mechanism and a prioritisation tool.

A well-designed report allows stable items to remain under automated statistical forecasting while planners focus their time on high-value, high-risk, or structurally changing demand.

## Core Demand Exception Categories

### 1. High Forecast Variance

A forecast variance exception occurs when actual demand differs materially from the forecast.

A typical rule might flag an item when:

**|Actual − Forecast| ÷ |Forecast| × 100% > X%**

Alternatively, the organisation may use an absolute unit variance, financial variance, standard-deviation limit, or forecast accuracy metric such as WAPE.

Large forecast errors can lead to stockouts when demand is underestimated or excess inventory when demand is overestimated.

However, a high percentage error does not always represent a serious business problem. For example, a difference between one unit and two units produces a 100% error but may have little financial impact. Exception rules should therefore consider volume, value, product criticality, and business impact—not percentage error alone.

### 2. Persistent Forecast Bias

Forecast bias occurs when forecasts are consistently higher or lower than actual demand.

A single over-forecast or under-forecast may be random. Repeated errors in the same direction suggest a systematic problem.

For example, an item may be flagged when it has been:

- over-forecast for three consecutive periods;
- under-forecast for three consecutive periods;
- outside an agreed cumulative bias limit; or
- above or below a tracking-signal threshold.

Persistent bias may indicate:

- declining or growing market demand;
- customer loss or acquisition;
- incorrect seasonality;
- outdated model parameters;
- inappropriate manual overrides;
- product substitution or cannibalisation; or
- a structural change that the statistical model has not yet recognised.

Bias exceptions are particularly important because a forecast can appear reasonably accurate in aggregate while still being consistently wrong in one direction.

### 3. Demand Spikes and Drops

Demand spikes and drops are unusually high or low observations compared with the normal demand pattern.

Possible causes include:

- one-off project orders;
- customer forward buying;
- competitor stockouts;
- promotional activity;
- order duplication;
- delayed orders;
- data-entry errors;
- customer destocking;
- product recalls; or
- changes in order frequency.

These observations require investigation because they may not represent repeatable demand.

When a temporary spike is treated as normal history, the forecasting model may project the event into future periods and overstate baseline demand. Similarly, an abnormal demand drop may reduce the forecast below the market's actual underlying requirement.

The planner must determine whether the observation represents:

- genuine recurring demand;
- a one-off event;
- a timing shift;
- an error in the data; or
- a structural change in the demand pattern.

### 4. Supply and Stockout Distortions

Recorded sales do not always equal actual customer demand.

When inventory is unavailable, sales history may show a decline even though customers still wanted to purchase the product. A forecasting model that uses only fulfilled sales may interpret the lower volume as reduced market demand.

This creates a serious planning problem:

**Sales < Demand**

The difference may represent backorders, lost sales, unfulfilled orders, substitutions, or customers purchasing from competitors.

A demand exception report should therefore identify periods affected by:

- stockouts;
- supply constraints;
- production interruptions;
- late inbound shipments;
- allocation controls;
- order cancellations caused by unavailable stock; or
- unusually low service levels.

Where sufficient evidence exists, planners may need to reconstruct or estimate unconstrained demand before using the history for forecasting.

### 5. High-Value and High-Risk Variances

Not every forecasting error deserves the same level of attention.

A 20% error on a low-value item may have little commercial impact, while a 10% error on a high-revenue or long-lead-time item may create a significant inventory or customer-service risk.

Exception reports should therefore incorporate business priorities such as:

- ABC classification;
- revenue or margin contribution;
- customer importance;
- product criticality;
- procurement lead time;
- supply risk;
- inventory value;
- shelf life; and
- contractual service requirements.

This allows planners to prioritise exceptions according to business impact rather than statistical error alone.

### 6. New Product Launch Deviations

New products require a different exception-management approach because they have little or no historical demand.

Instead of comparing actual demand with a mature statistical baseline, planners compare the launch performance with an agreed launch curve or commercial plan.

A launch exception may be triggered when actual demand differs from the planned launch volume by more than a specified tolerance, such as 20%.

Possible causes include:

- delayed market launch;
- slower customer adoption;
- distribution gaps;
- stronger-than-expected demand;
- promotional delays;
- insufficient inventory;
- incorrect customer assumptions; or
- cannibalisation of an existing product.

Launch exceptions may require changes to the demand trajectory, replenishment plan, safety stock, production schedule, or phase-in and phase-out assumptions.

## Demand Exception Review Procedure

A typical demand exception process can be represented as:

Data Ingestion → Data Validation → Exception Calculation → Exception Prioritisation → Planner Investigation → Root-Cause Classification → History Cleansing or Forecast Adjustment → Approval and Documentation → Demand Review and S&OP Input

### Step 1: Ingest the Required Data

The report normally combines information from several sources, including:

- historical sales or shipments;
- customer orders;
- statistical forecasts;
- inventory availability;
- stockout records;
- promotions;
- product lifecycle data;
- customer or account information; and
- product classifications.

The quality of the exception report depends heavily on the quality and consistency of these inputs.

### Step 2: Validate the Data

Before calculating exceptions, planners should check for basic data problems such as:

- missing actuals;
- duplicate transactions;
- incorrect dates;
- unit-of-measure inconsistencies;
- unusual negative quantities;
- product-code changes;
- discontinued items still included in the report; and
- incomplete stockout or promotional records.

Without this step, the report may generate false exceptions that consume planning time without improving the forecast.

### Step 3: Apply Exception Rules

The system compares actual demand, historical patterns, and future forecasts against predefined thresholds.

Examples include:

- actual demand more than 20% above or below forecast;
- forecast error above a financial or unit threshold;
- three consecutive periods of over-forecasting;
- tracking signal outside ±4;
- demand outside two standard deviations from the historical mean;
- forecast change above an agreed percentage;
- demand on a normally inactive item;
- no demand on a normally active item; or
- launch performance outside the approved rollout curve.

Thresholds should be treated as configurable business rules rather than universal standards.

### Step 4: Prioritise the Exceptions

A raw exception report may still contain too many items to review.

The exceptions should therefore be ranked according to factors such as:

- revenue impact;
- absolute unit variance;
- inventory exposure;
- forecast-value-added opportunity;
- customer importance;
- lead time;
- product criticality;
- persistence of the exception; and
- confidence in the statistical forecast.

A common approach is to assign each exception a risk score.

For example:

**Risk Score = Impact × Likelihood**

This ensures that planners address the most consequential exceptions first.

### Step 5: Investigate the Root Cause

The planner reviews each priority exception and determines why it occurred.

This investigation may require input from:

- sales;
- marketing;
- customer service;
- procurement;
- production planning;
- logistics;
- finance; or
- key account managers.

The investigation should distinguish between several different causes:

- true demand change;
- one-off demand;
- timing shift;
- supply constraint;
- data error;
- promotion;
- customer gain or loss;
- product substitution;
- lifecycle change; or
- forecasting-model failure.

An exception should not automatically result in a manual forecast adjustment. The correct response depends on the root cause.

### Step 6: Select the Planning Action

Once the cause is understood, the planner may take one or more actions.

**History cleansing**

Historical demand may be adjusted when an observation does not represent repeatable underlying demand.

Examples include:

- removing a duplicated order;
- replacing a stockout-affected sales figure with estimated unconstrained demand;
- excluding a one-off project order from the baseline;
- correcting an incorrectly dated transaction; or
- tagging a promotion so that it is not treated as ordinary baseline demand.

History cleansing should be controlled carefully. The original actual demand should remain available for audit and performance measurement, while a separate corrected series is used for modelling.

**Statistical model review**

The current forecasting model may need to be changed when the exception reflects a persistent modelling problem.

Possible actions include:

- changing the model family;
- revising seasonality;
- modifying trend assumptions;
- adjusting the forecast horizon;
- changing outlier treatment;
- updating intermittent-demand settings; or
- recalculating model parameters.

**Forecast override**

A manual override may be appropriate when reliable market intelligence is available and the statistical model cannot yet capture it.

Examples include:

- a confirmed customer contract;
- a planned promotion;
- a customer closure;
- a product launch delay;
- a known project order; or
- an agreed product phase-out.

Overrides should include a reason code, owner, expected duration, and supporting evidence.

**Inventory or supply action**

Some exceptions require operational action rather than a forecast change.

Examples include:

- expediting supply;
- reducing purchase quantities;
- reallocating inventory;
- revising safety stock;
- delaying production;
- increasing capacity; or
- reviewing supplier lead times.

### Step 7: Document and Approve the Decision

Each material exception should have a documented outcome.

A practical exception log may include:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| SKU or planning item | Product being reviewed |
| Location or customer | Relevant planning level |
| Exception type | Variance, bias, outlier, stockout, launch deviation, etc. |
| Exception value | Percentage, units, revenue or tracking signal |
| Root cause | Explanation for the exception |
| Action | Clean history, change model, override forecast or take no action |
| Forecast impact | Quantity or value of adjustment |
| Owner | Person responsible |
| Expiry period | When the override or assumption should be reviewed |
| Evidence | Promotion plan, customer advice, order data or supply record |
| Approval status | Draft, reviewed or approved |

This creates an audit trail and prevents the same issue from being repeatedly investigated without resolution.

### Step 8: Use the Results in the Demand Review

The completed exception review becomes an important input to the monthly Demand Review and wider S&OP process.

It provides:

- a prioritised list of demand risks;
- quantitative evidence supporting forecast changes;
- explanations for major variances;
- visibility of assumptions and overrides;
- potential inventory and service impacts; and
- issues requiring cross-functional decisions.

The report should support the meeting—not become the meeting itself. Detailed investigation should normally occur before the Demand Review so that meeting time can focus on decisions, unresolved risks, and material changes to the consensus forecast.

## Typical Exception Metrics and Actions

| Exception type | Illustrative threshold | Possible action |
|---|---|---|
| Sales spike | Actual demand greater than 150% of forecast | Determine whether demand is recurring; cleanse or tag one-off demand |
| Sales drop | Actual demand below 50% of forecast | Check stockouts, order timing, customer loss or demand decline |
| Persistent bias | Three consecutive periods in the same error direction | Review model, assumptions and manual overrides |
| Tracking signal | Outside ±4 | Investigate systematic forecast bias |
| High-value variance | Forecast error above 25% on Class A items | Immediate joint review with sales or account management |
| New launch deviation | Actual demand differs from launch plan by more than 20% | Revise launch curve, supply plan and safety stock |
| Stockout distortion | Low sales combined with poor product availability | Estimate unconstrained demand and review service failure |
| Abnormal forecast change | New forecast differs from previous forecast beyond tolerance | Validate new information and require change justification |
| No-demand exception | Normally active item records no demand | Check stockout, data failure, customer loss or lifecycle status |
| Unexpected demand | Demand appears on an inactive or discontinued item | Confirm order validity and product-status accuracy |

These thresholds are examples only. Each organisation should set its rules according to product behaviour, forecast horizon, business risk, data quality and planning capacity.

## Key Challenges in Practice

### 1. Setting Appropriate Thresholds

Thresholds that are too narrow create excessive alerts. Planners may then face hundreds or thousands of exceptions and begin ignoring the report.

Thresholds that are too wide may fail to identify important problems until they have already affected inventory or service.

The appropriate threshold may also vary by:

- product class;
- sales volume;
- demand pattern;
- forecast horizon;
- lifecycle stage;
- customer segment;
- margin;
- lead time; and
- supply risk.

A single 20% rule across the entire portfolio is rarely sufficient.

### 2. Avoiding Exception Overload

An exception report is useful only when the number of alerts is manageable.

If 40% or 50% of the portfolio is flagged every month, the report is no longer operating by exception. It has become another complete forecast review.

Organisations should monitor:

**Exception Rate = (Exceptions Flagged ÷ Total Items) × 100%**

A rising exception rate may indicate poor thresholds, deteriorating data quality, unstable demand, inappropriate forecasting models, or an excessively detailed planning hierarchy.

### 3. Separating Demand Problems from Supply Problems

One of the most common errors is interpreting low sales as low demand.

Sales may be lower because:

- inventory was unavailable;
- production was delayed;
- orders were rejected;
- deliveries were constrained;
- customers substituted another product; or
- orders were moved into another period.

Without supply and service information, planners may incorrectly reduce the forecast and reinforce the original stockout.

### 4. Distinguishing One-Off Events from Structural Change

A demand spike may be a one-time order, but it may also be the first sign of sustained growth. A demand decline may be a temporary timing issue, or it may indicate permanent customer loss.

The statistical result alone cannot reliably make this distinction.

Planners need commercial information, customer knowledge and repeated observations before deciding whether to cleanse the history or change the baseline forecast.

### 5. Controlling Manual Overrides

Exception management should reduce unnecessary intervention, not encourage planners to override every statistical forecast.

Frequent overrides can:

- introduce judgemental bias;
- reduce forecast consistency;
- hide model-performance problems;
- weaken accountability; and
- make forecast-value-added analysis difficult.

Every material override should therefore be measurable and supported by evidence.

Organisations should compare:

- the statistical forecast;
- the planner-adjusted forecast;
- the final consensus forecast; and
- actual demand.

This makes it possible to determine whether overrides improve or reduce forecast accuracy.

### 6. Measuring the Correct Demand Signal

Demand may be recorded as orders, shipments, invoices, consumption, point-of-sale transactions, or requested delivery quantities.

Each measure answers a different question.

For example:

- shipment history may be distorted by supply availability;
- order history may include cancellations or forward ordering;
- invoice history may differ from the requested delivery date;
- point-of-sale data may be unavailable for some channels.

The exception report must use a clearly defined demand measure that is appropriate for the organisation's planning objective.

### 7. Working at the Correct Level of Aggregation

An exception may disappear at an aggregate level while remaining severe at a detailed level.

For example, over-forecasting in one location may offset under-forecasting in another. The national forecast may appear accurate even though both warehouses have serious planning problems.

Conversely, reviewing demand at an excessively detailed level may create noisy and statistically unreliable exceptions.

The reporting level should match the level at which planning decisions are made, such as:

- SKU-location;
- SKU-customer;
- product family;
- sales channel;
- region; or
- total business.

### 8. Maintaining Master Data and Event Information

Exception reports depend on accurate classifications and event records.

Common problems include:

- incorrect ABC classifications;
- missing launch dates;
- obsolete product statuses;
- unrecorded promotions;
- inconsistent customer hierarchies;
- missing stockout indicators; and
- product-code changes that break historical continuity.

Without disciplined master-data management, the report may flag symptoms without providing enough information to identify the cause.

### 9. Ensuring Cross-Functional Participation

Demand planning cannot explain every exception independently.

Sales may understand customer changes. Marketing may know about promotions. Supply planning may identify capacity constraints. Customer service may know that orders were cancelled because stock was unavailable.

A successful exception-review process therefore requires clear ownership, response deadlines and cooperation across functions.

Without this participation, the report may identify the correct exceptions but fail to produce reliable decisions.

## Principles of an Effective Demand Exception Report

An effective report should be:

- **actionable**—every exception should lead to a defined investigation or decision;
- **prioritised**—high-impact items should appear before low-value statistical noise;
- **explainable**—users should understand why an item was flagged;
- **configurable**—thresholds should reflect different product characteristics;
- **auditable**—adjustments and overrides should retain reason codes and supporting evidence;
- **integrated**—the report should include demand, supply, inventory, lifecycle and commercial information;
- **measurable**—the organisation should track whether actions improve forecast performance; and
- **manageable**—the number of exceptions must remain within the team's review capacity.

## Conclusion

A Demand Exception Report is not simply a forecast-error dashboard. It is a structured decision-support process that identifies where statistical forecasts, actual demand and business expectations are materially misaligned.

Its value comes from concentrating planning effort on the exceptions that matter most.

To achieve this, the organisation must do more than define variance thresholds. It must establish a complete process for validating data, prioritising alerts, investigating root causes, cleansing history, controlling overrides, documenting decisions and escalating material risks into the S&OP Demand Review.

When designed well, demand exception reporting allows statistical models to manage stable demand while planners apply their judgement where business knowledge provides genuine additional value. When designed poorly, it produces alert overload, excessive overrides and repeated discussions without improving the forecast.

The objective is therefore not to generate more exceptions. It is to identify fewer, more meaningful exceptions—and convert them into better planning decisions.
